## e-Portfolio (School Purposes)

Work immersion output built within 12 hours. Coded from scratch because I refuse to build a website with drag and drop using `Wix.com`. Theme inspired from [leerob.io](https://leerob.io). Made with TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS.

- Included in `üèÖ Top 5 Best e-Portfolios Award` (All other awardees are made with `Wix.com`)
  - Total e-Portfolios: ~60
