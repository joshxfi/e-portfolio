          This site contains and showcases my achievements and projects I made
          along the way in my journey to becoming a professional software
          engineer. By having this e-Portfolio, I&apos;ll be able to keep track
          of my progress as I learn new technologies by documenting my journey
          and further improving my skills.

          Hello! I&apos;m Josh Daniel Ba√±ares, an 18-year-old freelance software
          developer from Bacolod City, and currently a senior high school
          student at STI West Negros University. I learn how to code by
          researching online and contributing to the open-source community. I
          started learning web development when I was 17 years old. There were
          times when I struggled and lost motivation, but I still dedicated my
          time to learning how to code. Because of the skills that I gained from
          my dedication, a senior software engineer offered me my first
          freelance gig and more offers came as time passed. Recently, I bought
          myself a brand new road bike as a reward for myself!
